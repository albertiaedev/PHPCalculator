This file contains the HTML code for the basic calculator user interface. It includes
a form with two input fields: one for the nubers to be calculated and another for the 
operation to be performed (addition, substraction, multiplication, or division). It 
also includes a link to the `style.css` file, which contains the CSS code for styling 
the calculator.
